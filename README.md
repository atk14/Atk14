ATK14 is a PHP Framework for fearless guys
------------------------------------------

ATK14 is a framework helping to build websites of any kind. If one dares to dip into ATK14, she or he gains:

* funny modelling, templating and controlling
* awesome form validations
* testing tools
* database schema migrations
* perfect headaches
* big-boy-like feeling

ATK14 consists of

* Form framework rewritten from Django by Mr. Valousek
* A smart template engine - [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/)
* Excellent jQuery integration library by Mr. Ganicky (atk14.js)
* A few PHP libraries developed by Mr. Tomek over last years, mainly:
  * DbMole, a database data mining creature
  * TableRecord, an ORM framework
  * a tool for sending proper emails
	* a tool for parsing YAML and XML and so on (some of them might look pretty meaningless)

At the moment ATK14 requires PHP5.3 and Postgresql as a database engine. Rumours say that ATK14 works on PHP5.4 as well.
